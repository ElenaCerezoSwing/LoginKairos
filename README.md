# login-kairos

Polymer web component configurable to login in firebase

## <font color=red>VERY IMPORTANT!</font>
Before you go on following the instructions please notice this component is configured to operate on a firebase project. Hence, you should have a firebase project to integrate this component. :sweat_smile:  

## Demo
You could find our component demo at the link below    

[login-kairos demo ](https://jsfiddle.net/eparrado/r4q8oa2L/)    

Here, you could appreciate the look and feel of the logo

And if you just one to copy and paste, here is the code:  
  
<login-kairos   
domain= **"PUT_YOUR_FIREBASE_DOMAIN_HERE_WITHOUT_HTTPS_PROTOCOL"**   
apikey= **"PUT_YOUR_APIKEY_HERE"**  
provider="google">  
\</login-kairos>  


   
## Use

Make sure what is your bower version
      
    bower --version 
 or 
 
    bower --v
    
Make sure your version is up to 1.8.3 or even higher. If not, please update it  


In case you do not have bower installed, please use the following instruction:

    npm install bower -g
    
After that step, please keep on following these instructions. And keep in your mind as a sacred word: __*our component should be installed in the same folder as your index.html is.*__


    cd myproyect
    cd /public "or in the folder where you have your index.html"
    bower install --save https://github.com/ElenaCerezoSwing/LoginKairos.git
    
    
#### Edit your HTML file and put the link to webcomponent into HEAD tags. It is necessary to use the POLYFILL script before the import  

Just to make even clearer this step you could read [Estela's article](https://medium.com/@E_parrado/polymer-to-chrome-and-beyond-bf4b25dbbc66)

    <head>
     ...    
     <script src="/bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js">
     </script>
     <link rel="import" href="/bower_components/login-kairos/login-kairos.html">
     ...
    </head>
    
#### Put the component into the BODY and fill the configure attributes with firebase configuration:

    <body>
      ...
      <login-kairos [attributes]></login-kairos>
      ...
    </body>
